# ToDo -- simply, stupid console app that store your TODO-list

Written just for fun and learning how Rust work with I/O.

## Help

TIP: You can replace ```cargo run``` to location of ToDo binary.

* ```cargo run add New cool task``` -- put task in a list.

* ```cargo run list``` -- display all tasks in a list.

* ```cargo remove 0 1 2``` -- remove tasks with IDs 0, 1 and 2 in a list.
